# UA-Navigation-Updated

for the code, Important files are fastapi_chatbot_backend.py , chatbot_ui.html,  the text_llm.py, and the geocoded_adderesses.xlsx 

code could be run the same way using the uvicorn fastapi_chatbot_backend:app and then the homepage could be fired up in the browser. API is hardcoded but also present in the .env file

Add the LLM component to it and later today if you do it successfully, we will work on displaying the Ramp and the elevator component of it.
